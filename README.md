There are eight different kinds of shells. They randomly fire off in an infinite loop. 

### Interaction
* Click anywhere for a firework to explode at that mouse position.
* Click and drag for a stream of fireworks to explode. Note that the animation may lag with several fireworks on screen.
* Press the spacebar to pause the fireworks.
* Press `s` to mute the sound effects.

### Acknowledgements
This was made for fun to get more familiar with javascript. The code is minimal and unoptimized. I used The Coding Train's coding challenge (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeyIbT3vXI)) and Lars Gottlieb's sketch (demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secondstep.dk%2Fp5doodles%2Ffireworks%2F&event=comments&redir_token=RTHX3yMAJzornT0OdTxflU3Z0VR8MTUyMzMxOTA3MUAxNTIzMjMyNjcx)) as starting points. The sound effects are from [soundsnap.com](https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/fireworks).
